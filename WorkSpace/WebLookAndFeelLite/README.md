WebLookAndFeelLite v0.35
==================

The Lite Version of the popular WebLookAndFeel Framework.
It contains all the necessary UI classes for most of the components but without dependency on
any other custom components. It can be used along with other LaF's as no custom components from the 
original framework are being used.

This is mostly intended for projects that want to use multiple LaF's and not solely on the WebLaF.

Since I made this targeting my project I have not made it general purpose so many things may be missing
from the original framework.
